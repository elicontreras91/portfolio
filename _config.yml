# Researcher & data scientist

I am a political scientist by training but have always had a close connection with the world of data throughout my career in public management. Although I started working in 2015, it was in 2019 that I shifted my career towards user experience research for the design and innovation of digital platforms. I enjoy working with products and services that improve people's quality of life and whose growth is based on evidence and active listening to their users. I believe that data and research should serve to empathize with people and create innovative products that generate value, are relevant, and accessible.
