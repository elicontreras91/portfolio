description: I am a political scientist by training but have always had a close connection with the world of data throughout my career in public management. Although I started working in 2015, it was in 2019 that I shifted my career towards user experience research for the design and innovation of digital platforms. I enjoy working with products that innovate and improve peopleâ€™s quality of life and whose growth is based on evidence and active listening to their users.
