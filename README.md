#### What I did: 
In order to start this exploration I selected an avaiable and public dataset about local government called the [National Registry of Municipalities (RENAMU)](https://www.datosabiertos.gob.pe/dataset/registro-nacional-de-municipalidades-renamu-2022-instituto-nacional-de-estad%C3%ADstica-e), which consist on a national-base survey about different topics about local management and tools on  1874 municipalities. Next, I validated this selection with the stakeholders and once I have and approval, I started the analysis process based on a four steps process:

- Download the dataset and the survey questionnaire to understand the data and to select the avaiable and relevant tables and questions
- Explore the selected tables and questions and create a common ID to join tables by an ID
- Conduct an exploratory analysis in SPSS to answer some business questions such as: what are the main procedures demmand by citizens that could be digitalize in municipalities? how often do municipalities use digital platforms?

- Design, elaborate and validate a dashbord on Power-Bi to understand the status about municipalities procedures.

### 2024: Strategic planning with gender and cultural diversity approach
#### _Client: Inter-American Development Bank_
#### Summary: 
The general project objective is to close gender and intercultural gaps on the strategic planning processes in all public entities in Perú. The government counterpart (National Center for Strategic Planning) have some tables about the how public entities register their planning procedures but the data avaiable was difficult to analyze due to its magnitud: it contains 4 tabs in excel, with more than 20,000 rows and 80 columns each. 

#### What I did: 
I helped cleaning the data avaiable on [Google colab using pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MIXMwEJfp4uZFKoVvuXGFwXPd9eBnjvC?usp=sharing), on a three steps process:
- Separate the four tabs into separate tables
- Delete the columns that weren't of interest
- Save the 4 new and clean tables on a CSV format

#### Tools & skills:
##### Technical skills:
- Data cleaning with Pandas (Python)
##### Soft skills:
- Communication with stakeholders to understand and empathize with their needs
