# Researcher & data scientist

#### Main digital products I've worked in:
##### Alert against racism (2024)
- Digital platform where citizens can report cases of racism and request legal and psychological assistance. I participated as a project manager at the final stage of the development
##### Digital request platform of the Peruvian State Facilita Perú (facilita.gob.pe)
- Created at the beginning of the pandemic to address a significant need in public entities: the digitization of their procedures and services. Facilita primarily focuses on rural public entities with low connectivity.
##### Gob.pe
- Digital platform that integrates all government information and services, similar to Gov.uk.
#### Digital enrollment platform (plataforma.matriculadigital.pe)
- Digital platform developed with the Ministry of Education to facilitate the digital enrollment process in public schools


## Data & research projects
### Identifying opportunities to digitalize products and services in Peru's local governments (2023)
#### _Client: Secretary of Government and Digital Transformation_
#### Summary: 
The Secretary of Government and Digital Transformation is a public entity responsible for the country's digital transformation to improve citizen's lifes through innovative digital products and services.

#### What I did: 
In order to start this exploration I selected an avaiable and public dataset about local government called the [National Registry of Municipalities (RENAMU)](https://www.datosabiertos.gob.pe/dataset/registro-nacional-de-municipalidades-renamu-2022-instituto-nacional-de-estad%C3%ADstica-e), which consist on a national-base survey about different topics about local management and tools on  1874 municipalities. Next, I validated this selection with the stakeholders and once I have and approval, I started the analysis process based on a four steps process:

- Download the dataset and the survey questionnaire to understand the data and to select the avaiable and relevant tables and questions
- Explore the selected tables and questions and create a common ID to join tables by an ID
- Conduct an exploratory analysis in SPSS to answer some business questions such as: what are the main procedures demmand by citizens that could be digitalize in municipalities? how often do municipalities use digital platforms?

    - [Powerpoint presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15B9vGfa4qRsFQCjUAbdC8mZ9UnpXeAc6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106305285872469110916&rtpof=true&sd=true),
- Design, elaborate and validate a dashbord on Power-Bi to understand the status about municipalities procedures.

### Strategic planning with gender and cultural diversity approach (2024)
#### _Client: Inter-American Development Bank_
#### Summary: 
The general project objective is to close gender and intercultural gaps on the strategic planning processes in all public entities in Perú. The government counterpart (National Center for Strategic Planning) have some tables about the how public entities register their planning procedures but the data avaiable was difficult to analyze due to its magnitud: it contains 4 tabs in excel, with more than 20,000 rows and 80 columns each. 

#### What I did: 
I helped cleaning the data avaiable on [Google colab using pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MIXMwEJfp4uZFKoVvuXGFwXPd9eBnjvC?usp=sharing), on a three steps process:
- Separate the four tabs into separate tables
- Delete the columns that weren't of interest
- Save the 4 new and clean tables on a CSV format

#### Tools & skills:
##### Technical skills:
- Data cleaning with Pandas (Python)
  
##### Soft skills:
- Communication with stakeholders to understand and empathize with their needs
